# D3-Challenge

A dynamic scatter plot was created based on a CSV file with 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau (https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) which includes rates of income, obesity, poverty, ect. by state. Using d3, each state is represented with a circle element with state abbreviations within. Three demographic and risk factor labels were placed on the scatter plot with click events so users can decide which data to display. Transitions for circle locations and range of axes were animated. Tooltips were also added to reveal a specific circle element's data when the user hovers their cursor over the element.
